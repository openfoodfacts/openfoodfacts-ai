of ingredients in different languages extracted from product packages using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). We want to \
extract the ingredients from this list using our algorithms. However, it is possible some typos or \
errors slipped into the list. Your task is to correct those errors following a guideline I provide you.

Correction guideline:
* If you recognize an ingredient and notice a typo, fix the typo. Otherwise, don"t; 
* Percentage numbers needs to follow this format: "<word> <d>,<d>%" for french, <word> <d>.<d>%" for the rest (d is a digit);
* Line breaks in the package list of ingredients leads to this error: "<subword1>  -  <subword2>". Join them into a single <word>;
* Some ingredients are surrounded by the element "_", such as _milk_ or _cacahuetes_, to detect ingredients that are allergens. But if "_" is used for anything else, such as "_Trazas de frutos de cáscara_", which is not an ingredient, remove them: "Trazas de frutos de cáscara";
* Don't try to over change the provided text. Keep it as it is and focus only on the previous cited rules;
* If you don't recognize an ingredient, that can happen because of the OCR, and you're not sure about the correct ingredient, keep it as it is;
* Don't invent new ingredients in the list if they're missing.
